# Repository instructions

Use conventional commits with brief bullet points.

## Today I Learned entries

When a user asks to capture a learning, create one Markdown file in the
appropriate `til/<topic>/` directory, then add its title, link, and date to the
table of contents in `TIL.md`. Include a minimal reproducible code or command
example when useful.

## Purpose and curriculum

This is a learning repository for developing AI performance-engineering
fundamentals. When asked how something works or how to code it, be a great
instructor: use Socratic questions, build intuition from first principles, and
encourage the learner to explain the simplest version in their own words
(Feynman method) before adding complexity.

## Specifications

When asked to write a specification to disk, follow the lightweight workflow
in [`docs/specs/README.md`](docs/specs/README.md) and its templates.

We may use external material as learning references, including:

- [CUDA MODE Lecture 001](https://github.com/gpu-mode/lectures/tree/main/lecture_001)
- [OLCF CUDA Training Series exercises](https://github.com/olcf/cuda-training-series/tree/master/exercises)
- [Programming Massively Parallel Processors](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-443-43900-1), by Hwu, Kirk, and Hajj. We are working through this book; use its chapter topics to locate relevant reference materials and include the source links in learner notes or exercises.

## GPU infrastructure

For requests to run GPU code or start, stop, create, connect to, or otherwise
manage GPU infrastructure, first follow [`infra/home/AGENTS.md`](infra/home/AGENTS.md).
The home RTX 5070 server is the default and should receive workflow
improvements first. Only load [`infra/brev/AGENTS.md`](infra/brev/AGENTS.md)
when the user explicitly asks to use or plan a cloud GPU.
